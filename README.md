There are some instruction to run this application in your local system:
Step:
    1. Make a clone of this application.
    2. There are 2 solutions, FrontEnd and Backend. Open the .sln file with Visual Studio(Recomended VS-2022).
    3. From Backend application go to appsetting.json file and set the connection string from your own.
    4. From FrontEnd application go to appsetting.json file and set the BaseAddress from your own.
    5. Now apply the migration from backend application. Check if Database is created then start the both of the project. May be facing some error from fronted the "No connection is made". for safety at first run the backend then run the front end application

    Future Plan: There are some features that should be added but unfortunately the lack of time and experience those could not be added. so my future plans for this application are:
        1. Add the validation of the properties
        2. Make the search realtime
        3. Adding some Js so that it could be more efficient
        4. Adding stock/warehouse management
        and so on
